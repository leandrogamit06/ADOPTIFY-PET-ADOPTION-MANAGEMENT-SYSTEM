        <h2>- MISSION STATEMENT -</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide care, shelter, and compassion to abandoned, neglected, and homeless animals. 
          We aim to rescue pets in need, restore their health and trust, and match them with responsible and loving families 
          who can offer them a safe and permanent home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond adoption, we strive to educate the community about the importance of animal welfare, responsible pet ownership, 
          and spaying or neutering to prevent overpopulation. Through kindness, commitment, and collaboration, 
          we work to create a world where every pet has the chance to live a happy, healthy, and fulfilling life.
        </p>

      <section class="vision">
        <h2>- VISION STATEMENT -</h2>
        <p>
          We envision a future where no animal is left behind a society built on compassion, where every pet is respected, 
          cared for, and cherished as part of a family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to inspire lasting change by promoting empathy and awareness, ensuring that every animal has the opportunity 
          to experience love and belonging.
        </p>
        <p>
          We dream of communities united by the belief that caring for animals not only saves lives but also strengthens 
          the bond between humans and all living beings.
