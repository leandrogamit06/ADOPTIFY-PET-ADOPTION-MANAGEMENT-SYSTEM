      <h2>HEALTHY PETS IS GOOD TO OUR HEARTS</h2>

      <p>Bringing home a new pet is exciting, but it also means you’ve got to look after their health right from the start. Make sure they get their core vaccines to keep them safe from the usual diseases.</p>

      <p>Don’t skip the vet visits and go at least once or twice a year so the vet can catch any issues early. Stay on top of deworming and flea or tick prevention too; parasites are no joke. If you haven’t already, spay or neuter your pet too.</p>

      <p>It keeps the pet population in check and lowers health risks for your furry buddy. Feed them a balanced diet that matches their age, breed, and size. And if you notice they’re eating less, acting weird, or just seem off, get them checked out.</p>

      <p>When you give your pet steady care and attention, you set them up for a long, healthy, happy life with you.</p>
