      <h2>Choosing a Good Veterinarian</h2>
      <p>Choosing a good veterinarian should be at the top of your checklist. Here are a few pointers to help you in your quest to find the perfect fit:</p>

      <p><strong>Get recommendations.</strong> Check with your friends who have pets for vet recommendations. Remember to ask about more than just the veterinarian. Get insight into location, hours, and the way staff members interact with pets.</p>

      <p>If you feel like the clinic will be a good fit, call and set up a time to come by the facility to evaluate for yourself. Visit the premises. Observe whether the clinic looks and smells clean. Does it feel like the place could use a thorough scrubbing, or does it smell clean and inviting? This is also the time to ask questions, so fire away.</p>

      <p>Ask about their office hours, the regular and emergency services they provide, what equipment they have (and don’t have) on site, and the like.</p>

      <p>Having a hard time making a final selection? When in doubt, feel it out. Vets have different personalities, so finding one whose demeanor matches yours can make all the difference. In any case, your vet should be compassionate. Your vet, after all, is an important partner in making sure your pets live long and healthy lives.</p>
